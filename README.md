# Pwelett Hackard Analysis

### Overview of The Project

Provided with a data set containing information regarding the ages of employees working for the Pwelett Hackard company. Tasked with conducting a database analysis on the future retirees within the company as well as determining who is eligible to be a participant in the mentorship program. All departments were to be included and the following dates were to be used as a way to determine elegibility.

Birth Dates: 1952 to 1955 <-- employees born within these years were ready to retire
Hired Dates: 1985 to 1988 <-- employees hired within these years are eligible for the mentorship program

### Results
This was my ERD that I used to visualize the Database and plan future SQL scripts

After creating my SQL script and creating the data csv files provided in the 'Data' folder, I found that around ~65% of the staff is to retire. I also created a table showing which employees can join the mentorship program, where they are considered a  senior employee.

### Summary
Based off of the fact that the company is losing over half od its staff to retirement, it is crucial for the company to get as many of those employees into the mentorship program to extend the amount of time to phase in new employees as old ones leave.
