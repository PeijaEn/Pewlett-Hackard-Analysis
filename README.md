# Pwelett Hackard Analysis

### Overview of The Project
Our client, Pewlett Hackard, wanted me to conduct a Database analysis on the future retirees currently working for the company. All departments were to be included and the dates between to determine elegiblity were the following:

Birth Dates: 1952 to 1955
Hired Dates: 1985 to 1988

### Results
This was my ERD that I used to visualize the Database and plan future SQL scripts

After creating my SQL script and creating the data csv files provided in the 'Data' folder, I found that around ~65% of the staff is to retire. I also created a table showing which employees can join the mentorship program, where they are considered a  senior employee.

### Summary
Based off of the fact that the company is losing over half od its staff to retirement, it is crucial for the company to get as many of those employees into the mentorship program to extend the amount of time to phase in new employees as old ones leave.
